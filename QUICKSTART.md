## Step 2: Submit Week 1 (2 minutes)

### Before You Start

**Track your week FIRST!** You need to know:
- ⏰ Total hours you worked this week
- 🤖 Hours that were automated (workflows running without you)
- 👥 Number of active clients
- 💰 Your revenue (we'll store as ratio 1.0)
- 📈 Percentage of revenue that's recurring

**Don't have data yet?** Use estimates for now. You can update later.

### Copy & Edit This Code

```python
from billion_tracker import *

# Initialize database (first time only)
init_database()

# Submit Week 1 - CHANGE THESE NUMBERS TO YOURS!
submit_weekly_metrics(
    week_number=1,
    
    # How many hours did you work this week?
    total_hours_worked=55.0,  # ← CHANGE THIS
    
    # How many hours were automated (saved by workflows)?
    automated_hours=8.0,  # ← CHANGE THIS
    
    # How many active clients?
    active_clients=3,  # ← CHANGE THIS
    
    # Revenue ratio (ALWAYS 1.0 for Week 1)
    revenue_ratio_to_baseline=1.0,  # ← DON'T CHANGE
    
    # What % of revenue is recurring/subscription?
    recurring_revenue_percentage=10.0,  # ← CHANGE THIS
    
    # What did you automate this week?
    what_i_automated_this_week="Email filters, automated meeting notes",  # ← CHANGE THIS
    
    # What's your biggest bottleneck?
    biggest_bottleneck_now="Manual client onboarding"  # ← CHANGE THIS
)
```

**Press Shift+Enter** to run.

You should see:
```
✅ Week 1 metrics submitted successfully!
📊 Automation Index: 14.5%
⏰ Time Saved vs Baseline: 0.0 hours/week
📈 Revenue Efficiency Multiple: 1.00x

## 💡 Tips for Success

### ✅ DO:

- **Track daily**: End of each day, log hours (2 min)
- **Be honest**: Data is for YOU, not judgment
- **Submit weekly**: Consistency beats perfection
- **Celebrate wins**: Every improvement matters
- **Share progress**: Community support is powerful

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Overthink it**: Good enough > perfect
- **Skip weeks**: Gaps make trends harder to see
- **Inflate numbers**: You're only cheating yourself
- **Compare to others**: Everyone's baseline different
- **Give up early**: Week 1-3 are hardest, gets easier
