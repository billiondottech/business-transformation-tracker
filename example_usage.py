üîÑ YOUR WEEKLY ROUTINE:

1. At start of week: Review last week's bottleneck
2. Throughout week: Track your hours (use provided spreadsheet)
3. End of week: Submit metrics using submit_weekly_metrics()
4. Review your dashboard: print_progress_table() and create_visualizations()
5. Share in community: Post your "automated this week" win!

üí° TIPS:

- Be honest with yourself about automated vs manual hours
- For "automated_hours": Only count tasks that run WITHOUT you
- For "revenue_ratio": 
  * Week 1 revenue = $10K ‚Üí use 1.0
  * Week 5 revenue = $12K ‚Üí use 1.2
  * Week 8 revenue = $15K ‚Üí use 1.5
  * Week 10 revenue = $9K ‚Üí use 0.9
  
- For "recurring_revenue_percentage":
  * Calculate: (Monthly Recurring Revenue / Total Monthly Revenue) √ó 100
  
- For "what_i_automated_this_week":
  * Be specific! "Automated lead enrichment" not just "made workflow"
  
- For "biggest_bottleneck_now":
  * Be honest! This helps you focus next week
  * This is what the community can help you solve

üéØ TARGETS BY WEEK 12:

‚úÖ Automation Index: 80%+
‚úÖ Time Saved: 50%+ reduction
‚úÖ Revenue Efficiency: 1.5x+ baseline
‚úÖ Client Capacity: 1.5x+ baseline  
‚úÖ Recurring Revenue: 50%+

üìä SHARE YOUR PROGRESS:

Export your charts and share in community:
- create_visualizations() ‚Üí Screenshot ‚Üí Post to WhatsApp
- Weekly check-in: "This week I automated: [X], Time saved: [Y]"
- Celebrate wins with the cohort! üéâ
